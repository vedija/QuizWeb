                    <p>In today's digital era, educational platforms are widely used to support both formal and informal
                        learning processes. However, many existing quiz platforms face limitations in terms of
                        accessibility, customization, and ease of use, particularly for users who seek a personalized
                        learning experience with subject-specific assessments.</p>

                <div class="p1">
                    <p>Traditional systems often lack flexibility in question management, randomization, and user
                        engagement, limiting their effectiveness for targeted learning and testing.To address these
                        issues, a new system named QuizWitz has been conceptualized. QuizWitz is designed to provide a
                        responsive, user-friendly interface for interactive subject-based quizzes.

                <div class="p1">
                    <p>The need for this system arises from the demand for a versatile and accessible quiz platform that
                        caters to diverse subjects while providing instant feedback and progress tracking. By storing
                        questions in a structured MySQL database and using Node.js for the backend, QuizWitz allows for
                        a scalable, efficient management of question sets and user data.
